## Description

This application allows users to play Rock, Paper, Scissors with an automated opponent called 'Computer'.

### Executing program

* To begin a game, click on the box of whichever you want to play.
* To select your champion simply click on the icon.
  - You can tell which champion you are about to select because it will grow when you over its icon.
* As soon as at least one round is played/completed, a 'CHANGE GAME' button will appear at the bottom of the screen.
  - Click it to return to the Game Menu to be able to pick a different version of the game to play.
* Similarly, as soon as the either player's win a game, a 'RESET SCORE' button will appear at the bottom of the page.

Both player's win total will persist after page closure/reload. Hence, if when the page is loaded at least one player's win total is greater than 0, the 'RESET GAME' button will start at the bottom of the page so that the scores may be reset by the user if they so wish.
