## Description

This application allows a user to play 'Rock, Paper, Scissors' with an automated opponent called 'Computer'. On page load, the user is provided the choice between playing the classic version of the game, or a more difficult variant. Regardless of which game they choose, users play as the 'Human' player.

### Executing program

* To begin a game, click on the box of whichever version you want to play: 'CLASSIC' or 'DIFFICULT'
* To select your champion simply click on the icon.
  - You can tell which champion you are about to select because it will grow when you hover over its icon with the cursor.
* After at least one round is played/completed, a 'CHANGE GAME' button will appear at the bottom of the screen.
  - Click it to return to the Game Menu , where you will be able to pick a different version to play.
* As soon as either player wins a game, a 'RESET SCORE' button will appear at the bottom of the page.
  - Click it to return both player's win count to 0.

Both player's win total will persist after page closure/reload. When the page is loaded, if at least one player's win total is greater than 0, the 'RESET GAME' button will start at the bottom of the page so that the scores may be reset if you so wish.

### Technologies

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
